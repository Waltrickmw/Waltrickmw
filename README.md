Hello! My name is William, I'm 26 years old and hold a degree in Business Administration. I've been working as a developer for just under 2 years now, dedicating myself to learning and improving my skills in this field.

On a daily basis, I mainly use Python, Groovy, and SQL to develop efficient and scalable solutions for a wide range of problems. I have experience in software development projects and process automation solutions, always striving to enhance my skills and knowledge.

I'm excited to collaborate on interesting and challenging projects and contribute to the developer community. If you want to learn more about me or discuss potential collaborations, don't hesitate to get in touch.
